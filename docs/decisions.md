# Decisions & deviations log

One entry per task that deviated from the plan or spec. Newest at the bottom.

## Task 9: simulation

- Fixture guard: new fixture files may ship with code; modifying existing ones needs
  ALLOW_FIXTURE_CHANGE=1 (human only).
- JC69 outcome order unified with K80 (same, transition, transversions alphabetical) per spec §4.2.
- Added k80_convergence test.

## Task 10: reference corpus

- PHYLIP dnadist K2P is a fixed-ratio estimator, not §4.3 K80; asserted as known divergence
  (spec §8.1, gap 6). UPGMA heights checked at tol\*depth. Owner sign-off.

## Task 11: fuzzing

- .gitignore: fuzz/corpus/, fuzz/artifacts/. Committed seed corpora in fuzz/seeds/.
- cargo-fuzz runs from inside the fuzz dir (no --manifest-path support).

## Task 12: wasm bindings

- SimSpec.seed typed as number; seeds limited to 2^53-1 (gap 7).

## Task 13: engine wrapper and session

- Outside Files block: neophylo-wasm serializer uses json_compatible + serialize_missing_as_null
  (None reaches JS as null, matching generated types); none_serializes_as_null parity test;
  js-sys wasm32 dev-dependency; step_counts test in nj.rs (n-3 steps + final join);
  vite.config.ts registers test setup.
- Added Session.alignmentOrigin (imported alignments are never re-simulated) and initialSession().
- Follow-up: to_js may return null on serialization failure (unreachable today); the TS wrapper
  should throw a clear Error so the Task 22 error boundary catches it.

## Task 14: tree layout

- Plan left these conventions unspecified; resolved as:
  - `scale` = `width / maxCum` (px per unit), 0 when maxCum is 0 so a zero-length tree never NaNs.
  - Leaf i sits at `(i + 0.5) * leafSpacing`; `height` = `leafCount * leafSpacing`.
  - Internal node y = midpoint of its outermost children.
  - Cladogram leaves align at max depth x so all tips share one x (required by the task's own test).
  - `visibleNodes`: positions come from the full tree; hidden nodes are omitted, never re-laid out.
    A visible node with a hidden/absent parent has `parentX === x` — no stub edge is drawn.
  - Phylogram only: when `clampNegative` is off, x positions are scaled over `maxCum - minCum`
    and shifted by `-minCum` so no node draws at x < 0. Cladogram depths are never negative.
  - `leaf` means "no visible children", so a cluster tip during stepping reads as a leaf.
  - `negative` is true only when the parent edge is actually drawn (visible parent) and length < 0,
    independent of `clampNegative`.

## Task 15: TreeView

- Outside Files block, all required by the plan's M3 preamble ("Component tests use Vitest +
  Testing Library + jsdom"), which no earlier task had set up:
  - package.json: devDependencies `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/dom`.
  - vite.config.ts: `test.environment = "jsdom"`.
  - src/test/setup.ts and src/layout/phylogram.test.ts: under jsdom `import.meta.url` is an
    http URL, so wasm/fixture paths fall back to cwd-relative resolution (vitest runs in web/).
- Plan ambiguities resolved:
  - "highlighted nodes are thicker and labeled": internal nodes are named
    u1, u2, … by creation order via state/names.ts; Tasks 16 and 18 must use nodeName.
  - `onHoverLeaf(label)` is called with the leaf's label on mouse enter and `null` on leave.
  - Fixed drawing geometry (viewBox 400-wide layout + label gutter); the svg scales via viewBox.
  - A "wrong clade" outline bounds the clade's laid-out nodes plus the branch leading to it;
    descendants hidden by `visibleNodes` are left out.

# Decisions & deviations log

One entry per task that deviated from the plan or spec. Newest at the bottom.

## Task 9: simulation

- Fixture guard: new fixture files may ship with code; modifying existing ones needs
  ALLOW_FIXTURE_CHANGE=1 (human only).
- JC69 outcome order unified with K80 (same, transition, transversions alphabetical) per spec §4.2.
- Added k80_convergence test.

## Task 10: reference corpus

- PHYLIP dnadist K2P is a fixed-ratio estimator, not §4.3 K80; asserted as known divergence
  (spec §8.1, gap 6). UPGMA heights checked at tol\*depth. Owner sign-off.

## Task 11: fuzzing

- .gitignore: fuzz/corpus/, fuzz/artifacts/. Committed seed corpora in fuzz/seeds/.
- cargo-fuzz runs from inside the fuzz dir (no --manifest-path support).

## Task 12: wasm bindings

- SimSpec.seed typed as number; seeds limited to 2^53-1 (gap 7).

## Task 13: engine wrapper and session

- Outside Files block: neophylo-wasm serializer uses json_compatible + serialize_missing_as_null
  (None reaches JS as null, matching generated types); none_serializes_as_null parity test;
  js-sys wasm32 dev-dependency; step_counts test in nj.rs (n-3 steps + final join);
  vite.config.ts registers test setup.
- Added Session.alignmentOrigin (imported alignments are never re-simulated) and initialSession().
- Follow-up: to_js may return null on serialization failure (unreachable today); the TS wrapper
  should throw a clear Error so the Task 22 error boundary catches it.
